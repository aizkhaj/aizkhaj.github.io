In the two months that I&#8217;ve been learning to code, and having done enough to get a solid understanding and application of frontend development, I want to discuss some of the challenges faced so far (that you may be able to relate to). I also want to talk about some goals ahead.

## Some Challenges I&#8217;ve Faced

I love challenges. I find them to be the perfect growth, and problem solving opportunity. In learning JavaScript, or Git, I have come across times where I was stuck or baffled. I still remember the first time I was stumped and demoralized: I was confidently going along Code School courses to learn the basics and intermediate level JS until I hit a checkpoint where I had to solve problems at Codewars.

My world came crashing at first. I felt like a fraud &#8211; &#8220;Where did all that knowledge and solving JS problems go?! Why can&#8217;t I figure this out?! Do I know anything at all? What is the meaning of life?! Who really let the dogs out?!!!&#8221; But then I reached out to my mentor and he calmed me down &#8220;it&#8217;s normal! You have to go through this phase&#8221;. He was right. Coding after all, is just a matter of feeling great after you solve pain in the butt problems. It&#8217;s that cycle of dopamine rush we&#8217;re all seeking. Eventually I did end up solving the problems &#8211; and I started becoming better day by day, as I kept working through the program.

I won&#8217;t even touch on the first time I came across DOM scripting with JavaScript. Let&#8217;s just say, self doubt was quite a prevalent factor then. However, I&#8217;m grateful for my mentor&#8217;s guidance, and the resources I ended up using (books, MDN, w3schools, stackoverflow, random blogs, etc.) that allowed me to paint a better picture in my head for the concepts I struggled with understanding.

Sometimes it was just a matter of letting a difficult or abstract concept sink in your head after applying it and seeing what it did.

## Some Goals

Goals are important. They guide your journey in any endeavor. With my coding skills, I would like to work on side projects that can potentially be useful and profitable. Ideally, something FinTech related would be great as I have the relevant experiences and the technical skills to produce useful tools for people. However, it&#8217;s not all just FinTech for me. Building out a SaaS or just a crazy, experimental idea as an exercise of your skills is something that I look forward to. I look forward to being able to implement all kinds of features and ideas. Heck, they don&#8217;t even need to be polished ideas &#8211; as long as they can stand on their own and do as they are intended to do.

Overall, I think a post on challenges and some goals is not good enough. I will post my challenges and goals as they update and I come across unknown territories. I have a feeling there will be plenty ahead :).
