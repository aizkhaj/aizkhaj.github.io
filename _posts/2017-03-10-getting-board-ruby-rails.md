I just completed my first checkpoint within Bloc&#8217;s curriculum on Ruby on Rails. It&#8217;s a slight bummer that we aren&#8217;t on node.js for the backend portion, but that&#8217;s ok. By now, I feel confident enough that I can pick up programming languages and concepts as I go along. After all, there&#8217;s still plenty of Ruby stacks out there that could use developers anyway. If I only knew node.js out of the gates, I&#8217;d only be good for what&#8217;s the hottest current, mainstream tech.

Besides, I hear Golang is picking up steam ðŸ˜‰

So far with Rails, I&#8217;ve gotten accustomed to using rvm to manage the different versions of items, creating/using gemsets. Sure that&#8217;s pretty basic, but I can now setup a basic Rails app. I think that&#8217;s pretty cool. I&#8217;ve even connected and setup a development environment + a production environment on Heroku with Postgres DB.
