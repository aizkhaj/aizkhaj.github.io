Up to this point, having gone through the Frontend side of learning/building with AngularJS (1 and 2), I have come across the concept of MVC. But here&#8217;s a pretty neat explanation of it that I have just come across. I like metaphors, so this will be good for reference. I&#8217;ll paraphrase the stuff so I&#8217;m not copying and pasting from Bloc&#8217;s material.

Think of the MVC architecture as a restaurant operation:

  * A customer (client/user) walks in and places an order with the waiter (controller).
  * The waiter (controller) routes the order to the kitchen (model&#8230;where logic is processed).
  * The waiter then brings the order (in form of a view) back to the customer (client).
