## Summary



## Explanation

Diving into Angular 2 + TypeScript was a task of its own, but a very fulfilling one at that. I remember spending the time to learn JavaScript ES6 concepts before I approached TypeScript (so I could understand newer concepts like modules, etc.)

## Thoughts

Coming from my previous AngularJS project, I found working with Angular 2 much cleaner and simpler to grasp. Instead of having separate templates and directives, components looked cleaner and more logical to work with.

Once those things were sorted, learning to implement a Firebase backend for the database was a good learning experience. As a result of using Firebase, I was able to connect user authentication with FirebaseUI. To keep things simple here, I only connected Google Authorization.
