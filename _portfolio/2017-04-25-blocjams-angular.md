## Summary

Bloc Jams AngularJS is functionally the same as the previous Bloc Jams project, except this one is built with AngularJS. It demonstrates HTML, CSS, JavaScript and AngularJS skills.

You can access the Github repo [here](https://github.com/aizkhaj/bloc-jams-angular).

If you want to play around with it, make sure you have GruntJS to serve it to your browser.

## Explanation

Bloc Jams is a demo project I built that integrates several things: responsive design and a functioning collection of album pages that are rendered via JavaScript and the ability to play a sample album. In order to incorporate AngularJS, I had to use a Task Runner to automate things like minification, compilation, etc. I picked GruntJS.

## Thoughts

As this project was used solely to learn and practice AngularJS more than anything, I can't say too much for a real world client problem that was solved here. I will take the opportunity to add my thoughts on Angular 1. It's a new paradigm coming from the world of vanilla JavaScript and simple DOM manipulation sprinkled with jQuery.

Learning about the MVC architecture was an interesting perspective on its own. The fact that you can build Single Page Applications by dividing up logic by Model, View and Controller sounded like a brilliant concept. You mean to say things don't have to look so messy?! Logic can be separated from the Template view?! Mind blown.

The original Bloc Jams may look exactly like this one, but this project was a complete redo in a lot of ways due to the architecture of AngularJS.
