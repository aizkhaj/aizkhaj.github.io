title: ShoutOut - A Chat App.
thumbnail-path: "img/shoutout.png"
short-description: This project is a very basic, no frills chat application. I used this project to learn Angular 2 + TypeScript. The application was also my first experience working with a NoSQL database (provided by Firebase). User authentication is connected to Google via FirebaseUI.

## Summary

 This was a really cool project. I knew Angular 2 was out and much different than AngularJS, so I had to test it out. The application is basically something along the lines of Slack, minus all the emoji and sophisticated channels functionality.

You can access the Github repo [here](https://github.com/aizkhaj/shoutout).

If you're going to serve this up, make sure you have Angular-CLI to "`ng serve`" it.

## Explanation

Diving into Angular 2 + TypeScript was a task of its own, but a very fulfilling one at that. I remember spending the time to learn JavaScript ES6 concepts before I approached TypeScript (so I could understand newer concepts like modules, etc.)

## Thoughts

Coming from my previous AngularJS project, I found working with Angular 2 much cleaner and simpler to grasp. Instead of having separate templates and directives, components looked cleaner and more logical to work with.

Once those things were sorted, learning to implement a Firebase backend for the database was a good learning experience. As a result of using Firebase, I was able to connect user authentication with FirebaseUI. To keep things simple here, I only connected Google Authorization.
