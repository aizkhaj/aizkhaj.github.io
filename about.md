It's only fair that I start the page here with a: `print "hello world!"`

My name's Aizaz. That's pronounced Ae-zaz.

I'm a thinker and a doer. The core of why I pursue so many things is because I don't like to be boxed in.

It just so happens that I enjoy journalling, and see writing as a means to learning more while connecting with people and organizations.

This place is for me to show off my experiments/projects in code, talk about the new things I learn or just discuss challenges and how you can also overcome them. It's also where I get to share thoughts on a wide range of topics including but not limited to:

  * Digital Marketing
  * Business and Economics
  * Finance and Capital Markets

Overall, I want to make an impact with my code by solving problems. "Create value" is my focus.
