Aizaz is a full stack developer with experiences in business analysis and capital markets. Since it is awkward talking about yourself in third person, I will say:

Hello, I'm Aizaz. Thanks for checking this place out. I like to make an impact with my code by solving problems that matter more than what may be trivial things. "Create value" is my focus. Other than that, this place also serves as a place for me to show off my experiments in code, talk about the new things I learn or just discuss challenges and how you can also overcome them.
